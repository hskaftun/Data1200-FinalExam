        <h3 >How would you define Fake News? What do you think are its defining characteristics? Try to create your own definition of what qualifies as Fake News.</h3>
          <p class="topicalinfo-paragraph"> Our group believes fake news first became known when the earlier president of America, Donald Trump used the term “fake news” in order to scrutinize the media
          and the facts they were saying about his politics and himself.
          <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-46175024" target="_blank">How Trump took 'fake news' into the mainstream(video) </a> We have agreed that fake news is not an issue which has a huge focus in this country, however,
          it is in other countries such as USA. This allows us to see the consequences which follow in such phenomena’s.</p>

          <p class="topicalinfo-paragraph">The phrase “fake news” can be defined as news which have not happened. Fake news can stem from people misunderstanding what has happened which then becomes fake news.
          On the other hand, fake news can be used for individuals to be cynical in ways such as propaganda </p>

          <p class="topicalinfo-paragraph">For our group to come up with a definition of fake news, we have used the video in module 4.1 for inspiration and a way to gain knowledge on this topic.<a href="https://mediasite.oslomet.no/Mediasite/Play/f6159375b6374725a0ba901df2586db01d" target="_blank">Watch module 4.1(video</a> As a group we 
          have agreed that for something to be considered “fake newss” it cannot be true but there also has to be a reason as to why things are being done/said. This is either 
          done to hurt a person´s name or image if there is an underlying economical winning behind of the fake news.</p>

        <h3>What can you do as an individual to help tackle the problem of mis- and disinformation on the internet, both in terms of your personal and your professional life?</h3>
          <p class="topicalinfo-paragraph">Over the past years it has been common with fake news online. An example of this can be the misinformation being published about covid-19. But how is someone supposed 
          to understand whether it is fake news or further spreading of previously stated news?</p>

          <p class="topicalinfo-paragraph">To begin with we must be critical no matter what we read online. There is a large amount of positivity coming from social media, however, one negative side is everyone 
      has a platform which has a wide reach. We must be critical especially to topics which interest us due to the fact that people can use these platforms to write misinformation.
          It is at this point it is wise to check where these facts are coming from. Is this from a blog or from a newspaper?</p>

          <p class="topicalinfo-paragraph">Another thing which can be easy to forget is when has what you are reading been written? The information could have been true before, but the information can have changed 
          over time with new applied research. </p>
          <p class="topicalinfo-paragraph">There are many things you can do so you do not give into fake news, whether it is private or in a job environment. A good rule to remember is to be critical since everyone 
          can publish words online. Being critical will ultimately lead to fake news being read and distributed further. </p>
